  "body": "To get started read our published work in [Methods in Ecology and Evolution](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12590/full) and [PLoS ONE](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/14/069427).\r\n\r\nOur package documentation includes both an [introductory](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/climwin/vignettes/climwin.html) and an [advanced](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/climwin/vignettes/advanced_climwin.html) vignette that provide an overview of important features included with the package. A fully inclusive user manual with FAQs is currently a top priority and will replace these vignettes.\r\n\r\n_climwin_ is a versatile toolbox for climate window analyses in the R statistical computing environment. Climate window analysis is an exploratory method in which users can test for periods of climatic sensitivity, where variation in climate strongly drives variation in a biological trait. _climwin_ allows users to test the impact of all possible climate windows within a specified range, comparing windows using an information criterion approach. This approach removes the need to designate arbitrary windows over which we measure climate, which often occurs with little biological justification.\r\n\r\n#Main features of the package:\r\n\r\n##Statistical analysis\r\n* Sliding window analysis.\r\n* Weighted window analysis (Weibull and Generalised Extreme Value distributions).\r\n* k-fold cross validation in window selection.\r\n* Methods to guard against false positive results (comparison to randomised data).\r\n* Range of summary statistics for testing climate impacts (e.g. mean, max, slope).\r\n* Ability to test linear, quadratic, cubic, logarithmic and inverse impacts of climate.\r\n* Compatibility with a range of model functions (e.g. lmer, glmer, coxph).\r\n\r\n##Visualisation\r\n* AICc values of all tested climate windows.\r\n* Model beta values of all tested climate windows (including potential quadratic and cubic terms).\r\n* Model weight values of all tested climate windows, highlighting the 95% confidence set.\r\n* Boxplot climate window range within the 95% confidence set.\r\n* 3D visualisation of AICc and model weights.\r\n\r\nOver time we hope to include additional features to improve the versatility of _climwin_.\r\n\r\nDevelopers: [Liam D.
