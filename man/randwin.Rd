\title{Climate window analysis for randomised data}
\usage{
randwin(repeats = 1, Xvar, Cdate, Bdate, baseline, furthest, closest, stat,
  func, type, cutoff.day, cutoff.month, Cmissing = FALSE, Cinterval = "day",
  upper = NA, lower = NA, thresh = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{repeats}{The number of times that data will be randomised and analysed
for climate windows}

\item{Xvar}{The climate variable of interest. Please specify the parent
environment and variable (e.g. Climate$Temp)}

\item{Cdate}{The climate date variable (dd/mm/yyyy). Please specify the parent
environment and variable name (e.g. Climate$Date).}

\item{Bdate}{The biological date variable (dd/mm/yyyy). Please specify the
parent environment and variable name (e.g. Biol$Date).}

\item{baseline}{The baseline model structure used for testing correlation.
Currently known to support lm, glm, lmer and glmer objects.}

\item{furthest}{The furthest number of time intervals (set by Cinterval) back
from the cutoff date or biological record that you want to include in your
climate window search.}

\item{closest}{The closest number of time intervals (set by Cinterval) back
from the cutoff date or biological record that you want to include in your
climate window search.}

\item{stat}{The aggregate statistic used to analyse the climate data. Can
currently use basic R statistics (e.g. mean, min), as well as slope.
Additional aggregate statistics can be created using the format function(x)
(...). See FUN in \code{\link{apply}} for more detail.}

\item{func}{The function of the climate variable.}

\item{type}{fixed or variable, whether you wish the climate window to be variable
(i.e. the number of days before a biological record is measured) or fixed
(i.e. number of days before a set point in time).}

\item{cutoff.day,cutoff.month}{If type is "fixed", the day and month of the year
from which the fixed window analysis will be set.}

\item{Cmissing}{TRUE or FALSE, determines what should be done if there is
missing climate data. If false, the function will not run if missing climate
data is encountered. If true, any records affected by missing climate data
will be deleted from climate window analysis.}

\item{Cinterval}{The resolution at which climate window analysis can be
conducted. Can be days ("day"), weeks ("week"), or months ("month"). Note the units
of parameters 'furthest' and 'closest' will differ depending on the chouice
of Cinterval.}

\item{upper}{Cut-off value used to determine growing degree days or positive
climate thresholds (determined by parameter thresh). Note that when values
of lower and upper are both provided, randwin will instead calculate a
optimal climate zone (?).}

\item{lower}{Cut-off value used to determine chill days or negative
climate thresholds (determined by parameter thresh). Note that when values
of lower and upper are both provided, randwin will instead calculate a
optimal climate zone (?).}

\item{thresh}{TRUE or FALSE. Determines whether to use values of upper and
lower to calculate binary climate data (thresh = TRUE), or to use for
growing degree days (thresh = FALSE).}
}
\value{
Will return a dataframe containing information on all fitted climate
 windows. See \code{\link{MassRand}} as an example.
}
\description{
Will randomise biological data and carry out a climate window analysis. Used
to help determine the chance of obtaining an observed result at random.

# Test climate windows for random data using Mass dataset

# Note all other parameters are fitted in the same way as the ClimateWindow function.
